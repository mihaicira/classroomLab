           The <b>ClassroomLab</b> is a classroom where selected courses are taught, an infrastructure for conducting experiments in teaching and methodology methods, and finally an arena for collaboration between students, teachers, researchers and the world of work.<br>

           The overarching aim of ClassroomLab project is to integrate education at WUT and NTNU through the design of pioneering interdisciplinary modules that, through multiplier effect, will be incorporated into new graduate programs and relevant existing training schemes proposed by institutions with varying orientations, in order to address the rapidly altering need to cope with challenges related to work integration and marginalization of vulnerable persons.<br>

           Classroom Laboratory Joint Course will be offered to all the 1st cycle students from WUT and NTNU; Professors, teachers, researchers and administrative staff from WUT and NTNU; world of work (Economic agents, employers and work integration services providers for vulnerable groups – Roma, persons with disabilities, migrants).

    <div class="content_title">Impact on target Groups</div>
    <div class="content_text">
           <b>Students</b> are the main target group for the Classroom Laboratory joint course. One overall objective of the Classroom Laboratory project is the enhancement of the quality and relevance of education and training. Classroom Laboratory Join Course aims at providing to the students: an international and inter-disciplinary environment for developing transversal competences; pedagogical materials, guidelines for the process model learning method, experiential learning; a technology-dense infrastructure for participating at experiments in learning methods, an arena for collaboration with teachers, researchers and the world of work.
<br>
            <b>Teachers, researchers, administrative</b> staff from project's HEIs are coopted to ensure the quality of the project's activities implementation, to strengthen the collaboration between WUT and NTNU and build a cooperation network between universities and the world of work. Teachers, researchers and administrative staff from both HEIs will directly participate at C1 Process Model learning method (ISP); C2 Demonstrative Classroom Laboratory (STTE); C3 Classroom Laboratory Joint Course (seminar); and at project's multiplier events E1 CommTech Workshop and E2 Impact Workshop.
        <br>
           The ClassroomLab project directly aim the cooperation and partnership between education and the<b> World of Work</b>. Economic agents from industry, multinational companies, trade and services, HR recruiting companies, employment agencies and nongovernmental organizations promoting social inclusion through work integration programs for vulnerable persons – Roma persons, persons with disability and migrants -, will be directly involved in the Classroom Laboratory Joint Course learning process. Thus, the integrated approach of the Classroom Laboratory Joint Course reinforces the link between the educational offer and the dynamics and demands of the world of work.

    <div class="content_title"><a href="Activities.html">Activities</a></div>
    <div class="content_text">
        In order to accomplish the objectives of the project and the main expected results four activities will be organized:
    <br>
           <b><a href="Activities.html#activity_1">A1. Process Model learning method</a></b> (will elaborate the intellectual output O1 Classroom Laboratory Reader on the basis of the guidelines, suggestions and impact recorded during the five days of Intensive Study Program (ISP) C1 Process Model learning method at NTNU and specific scientific documentation)
        <br>
           <b><a href="Activities.html#activity_2">A2. Planning the Classroom Laboratory Joint Course</a></b> (will elaborate the O2 Curricula of the Classroom Laboratory Joint Course on the basis of the five days short term joint staff training (STTE) on C2 Demonstrative Classroom Laboratory Joint Course at WUT)
        <br>
           <b><a href="Activities.html#activity_3">A3. Implement the Classroom Laboratory Joint Course </a></b>(the C3 Classroom Laboratory joint course will be implemented at WUT and NTNU by including it in the educational offer available for students starting with the first semester of 2020-2021 academic year, with 28 hours of lectures, and concluded with evaluation, 2 ECTS and a mutually recognized certificate. In this way, the Classroom Laboratory joint course will be implemented in a truly integrated way at WUT and NTNU. During the implementation period it will be elaborated, tested and used as a research instrument the O3 Classroom Laboratory Impact Tool, which will summarize the foreseeable impact of Classroom Lab joint course on both HEI’s involved: students and academic staff from NTNU and WUT.)
        <br>
                   <b><a href="Activities.html#activity_4">A4. Classroom Laboratory Joint Course Impact</a></b> (will produce at least one O4 joint publication elaborated by a joint research team from both HEI’s involved, NTNU and WUT, on the bases of the project results).
    </div>

    <div class="content_title">Results</div>
    <div class="content_text">   The main expected result is the knowledge transfer, to develop at the WUT, after the NTNU model, the basis of the Classroom Laboratory for cooperation between education, economy and work integration of vulnerable groups (Roma, persons with disabilities, migrants), to transfer its structure, comprehensive approach, Process Model learning approach, teaching and research methods suitable for implementing a successful Classroom Laboratory Joint Course at WUT and NTNU.
